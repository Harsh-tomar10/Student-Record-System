# Student-Record-System

Student Record Management System
1. Object-Oriented Concepts Used

Classes & Objects: Student class models student records.

Inheritance: Student extends Person to reuse name property.

Encapsulation: Data fields stored inside class with methods to modify them.

Constructors: Default and parameterized constructors initialize objects.

2. Methods Implemented

inputDetails(): Takes user input using Scanner.

displayDetails(): Prints student details.

calculateGrade(): Computes grade based on marks.

3. Arrays / Collections

ArrayList is used to store multiple student objects dynamically.

4. Control Structures

Loops for menu repetition.

Conditionals (if-else) to calculate grade and handle menu choices.

5. Menu-Driven Program

Provides 3 options: add student, display students, exit.

Ensures smooth user interaction using Scanner.

6. Data Validation (Basic)

Marks are entered as double; grade assigned based on ranges.
